/**
 * An interface representing a mutable gap buffer, containing a sequence of [Int], which is
 * optimized for chunk insertions and removals.
 *
 * Gap buffers are data structures which support amortized constant-time consecutive insertions,
 * similarly to an array-based list, but at arbitrary buffer positions. They may be used to store a
 * sequence of items which are known to be inserted group-wise.
 *
 * In a gap buffer, positions are known as offsets. An offset is semantically identical to an index
 * in an array, except that it jumps over the gap.
